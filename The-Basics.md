  <dt><a href="https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/parr.html" target="_blank">PARR (Public Access to Research Results)</a></dt>
  <dd>This is the federal mandate that says we have to make our research data available to the public.</dd>

  <dt><a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/" target="_blank">NCEI (National Centers for Environmental Information)</a></dt>
  <dd>Serves as the designated archive for NOAA’s environmental data, responsible for its long-term preservation and accessibility.</dd>

  <dt><a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/inport/" target="_blank">InPort</a></dt>
  <dd>This is our metadata catalog. Every dataset needs an InPort record so people can find it and understand it. It’s the who, what, where, when, and how for your data.</dd>

  <dt><a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/archive/send2ncei/" target="_blank">S2N (Send2NCEI)</a></dt>
  <dd>This is the website you’ll use to bundle up your data, metadata, and other documents into a package to officially send to the NCEI archive.</dd>

  <dt><a href="https://www.noaa.gov/information-technology/open-data-dissemination" target="_blank">NODD (NOAA Open Data Dissemination)</a></dt>
  <dd>This is our go-to for putting large datasets (like raw imagery) on Google Cloud so people can access them.</dd>
